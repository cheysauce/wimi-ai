# 📚 WiMi AI — Chinese Vocabulary Frequency Tool

A web app for turning Chinese text into a ranked vocabulary study list. Paste text, upload files, or record/upload audio — the app segments the Chinese, adds pinyin and English translations, tags HSK levels, and ranks words by study priority.

4. **English translations** — looked up from the HSK 1–6 dictionary automatically
5. **Optional AI translation** — fills in missing translations via OpenAI API
6. **Study priority score** — ranks words by frequency + difficulty vs. learner level
7. **Audio input** — record from mic or upload audio files (WAV, MP3, M4A, OGG, FLAC), auto-transcribed via Whisper
8. **Text input** — paste text directly or upload `.txt` files
9. **Download CSV** — export the full vocabulary table

## 📖 Dictionary & HSK Levels

The app reads directly from the HSK 1–6 xlsx file for both translations and level data — no separate CSV files needed. It supports both single-sheet and multi-sheet xlsx formats automatically.

If a word is not in the HSK file, the app marks its level as `unknown` and gives it a moderate difficulty penalty in the scoring.

---

## 🤖 Optional AI Translation

Words not found in the HSK dictionary can be translated using OpenAI's API:

1. Get an API key from [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com)
2. Enter it in the sidebar under **Optional AI translation**
3. Click **AI-translate missing words**

For production use, consider caching AI translations to avoid repeated API costs.

## 📊 Study Priority Formula

The score combines:

- **Frequency** in the uploaded text
- **Difficulty** compared with the learner's HSK level
- **Unknown level penalty** for words outside HSK 1–6
- **Word length** as a small complexity signal

Higher score = **study this word sooner**. This is a practical heuristic, not a scientific language acquisition model. The formula can be tuned in `core.py`.
